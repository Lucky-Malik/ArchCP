ArchCP is a collection of linux/i3 configuration/dotfiles to optimize Competitive Programming Workflow.
It is made for CPers who embrace the hyperoptimized workflows and want a custom config that speeds up the
tedious tasks around giving and analyzing contests.

Features :

1. A TUI to participate into contests accross different platfroms.
2. Automatic problem parsing and scaffolding for contest problems.
3. Automatically load custom templates inside the scaffolded directories.
4. Contest Mode to switch off distractions, that blocks distracting applications, opens contest page and neovim inside contest directory
5. It has an inbuilt Competition fetching API integrated into the status bar to keep track of upcoming contests.
6. You can add your profiles from different platforms to monitor rating and rank changes.
This feature is also integrated in to the status bar itself.

We made this with love for CPers from around the globe and as an Open sourced resource where anyone can contribute and customize
the files for their own likings and flavours.
